Lab 1 and 2 were both fine.

Lab 3 had some issues with output marks being removed and a being calculated wrong (I believe it should be 2?).

Project 1 has alot of clears and can be done easily without using those clears and just keeping the a,b,w,l,h vars constant but got full marks for the coding part.

Project 2 also had full marks for coding part.
