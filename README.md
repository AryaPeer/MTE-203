Lab 1 and 2 were both fine.

Lab 3 had some part marks removed. One of the vals should be 2 instead of what I calculated for due to something like ./ vs. / or bracket placement.

Project 1 has alot of clears and can be done easily without using those clears and just keeping the a,b,w,l,h vars constant but got full marks for the coding part.
